Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]



public class Solution {
    public void ReverseString(char[] s) 
    {
       for(int i=0; i<s.Length / 2 ; i++)
       {
           char temp = s[i];
           s[i] = s[s.Length-1-i];
           s[s.Length-1-i] = temp;
                      
       }
      
    }  
    
}

// for loop to swap 
// create temp char value in for loop 
//set beginning value to temp
// swap last value with the beginning value
//set last value to temp
